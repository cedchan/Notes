**Intermediate levels:** Forms of words between the UR and SR.

**Crucial ordering:** An ordering that is required to derive the correct form.

**Mutually non-affecting:** Rules such that the ordering doesn't matter. 

**Surface-true generalization:** A generalization that is true across surface forms.

## Bleeding

Consider rules $X: X_d \rightarrow X_c, Y: Y_d \rightarrow Y_c$ 
Let $F=Y \circ X, B=X \circ Y$.

| | Definition | As Maps |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Feeding** | If applying rule $X$ allows rule $Y$ to apply somewhere it otherwise wouldn't, $X$ **feeds** $Y$. $X$ and $Y$ are in a **feeding order**. | $c\notin Y_d$, but $X(c)\in Y_d$ |
| **Bleeding** | If applying rule $X$ prevents rule $Y$ from applying somewhere, $X$ **bleeds** $Y$. $X$ and $Y$ are in a **bleeding order**. | $c\in Y_d$, but $X(c)\notin Y_d$ | 
| **Counterbleeding** | When rule $Y$ obscures conditions that rule $X$ uses to apply. If $X, Y$ are in bleeding order, $Y, X$ is the counterbleeding order. | $X$ bleeds $Y$ but we apply $Y \circ X$ |
| **Counterfeeding** | When rule $Y$ creates new forms which could allowed $X$ to apply, but don't. If $X, Y$ are in feeding order, $Y, X$ is the counterfeeding order. | $X$ feeds $Y$ but we apply $X\circ Y$ |
