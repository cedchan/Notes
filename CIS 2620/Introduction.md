## Part A: Regular Languages

**Finite automata:** Formal model of finite-state computation
- Regular languages are the class of problems that can be solved by FSMs
- Establishing non-solvability by finite automata

>It is not possible to construct a Turing machine that takes as input the description of another Turing machine and decides whether or not the execution of the input machine terminates.

Given a multi-variable polynomial $p(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots)$, are there integer values for the variables that make the polynomial $0$?
