## Sound Production

### Phases of Sound Production

*Typically*, sound is produced with
1. **Respiration**: Expiration—producing sounds by breathing out
2. **Phonation**: Vibrate vocal folds
3. **Articulation**: Change quality of sound by shaping vocal tract

### The Vocal Organs

The trachea and lungs provide air support for sound production, while the 3 cavities—**pharyngeal, nasal,** and **oral**—change sound quality.

The **larynx** is composed of multi-layered membranes called **vocal folds**. The space between vocal folds is called the **glottis**. The **epiglottis**—which blocks off the trachea (for swallowing)—is also in the larynx. Muscles in the larynx can, for example, lengthen the larynx to raise pitch.

**Supralaryngeal articulation** occurs above the larynx, such as in the
- Pharynx
- Oral cavity
- Nasal cavity
- Tongue
- Lips
- Palate (hard/soft)
- Teeth
- Mandible (lower jaw)

The **tongue** is divided, from front to back, into 
1. Tip (apex)
2. Blade (lamina)
3. Body—front/back
4. Root

The tongue is the most **active articulator** (meaning we have a high degree of control over it). Most sounds combine movement of active articulators with **passive articulators**.

The **palate** can be divided into (from front to back)
- Alveolar ridge
- Hard palate
- Soft palate / velum (often an active articulator)
- Uvula
