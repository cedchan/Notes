The **distribution** of a segment or sound category is the set of positions it can occupy in an utterance.

**Complementary distribution:** Segments that share an underlying representation and can't occur in the same position.

**Contrastive distribution:** Segments that occur in the same position and thus cannot share the same underlying representation.

**Restrictive distribution:** Restrictions on the positions that a segment can occur in.
