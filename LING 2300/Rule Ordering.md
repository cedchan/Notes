## Bleeding

Consider rules $A: A_d \rightarrow A_c, B: B_d \rightarrow B_c$ 

| | Definition | As Functions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Feeding** | If applying rule $A$ allows rule $B$ to apply somewhere it otherwise wouldn't, $A$ **feeds** $B$. $A$ and $B$ are in a **feeding order**. | $c\notin B_d$, but $A(c)\in B_d$ |
| **Bleeding** |  If applying rule $A$ prevents rule $B$ from applying somewhere, $A$ **bleeds** $B$. $A$ and $B$ are in a **bleeding order**. | $c\in B_d$, but $A(c)\notin B_d$ | 
| **Counterfeeding** | | |
| **Counterbleeding** |  | |
