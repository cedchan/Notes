Linguists differentiate **lexical syntactic categories**, which are typically open-class and correspond to real-world phenomena, with **functional syntactic categories**, which are typically used for grammatical constructs.

|Lexical Categories|Functional Categories|
|-|-|
|noun, verb, adjective, adverb | preposition, article, demonstrative, quantifier, pronoun, auxiliary verb, etc.|

Because of ambiguity in the potentially multiple meanings/uses of words, or even what constitutes a "word," linguists define syntactic categories by **syntactic** and **morphological distribution**. That is, by the grammatical role they (typically) play in sentences, as well as common morphological features they have.

>**Example.** Nouns typically have the following characteristics.
>Syntactic Distribution:
>- subject/object of sentence
>- object of preposition
>  
>Morphological Distribution:
>- bears plural morphology
>- some derivational affixes (e.g., *-tion*)

## Detailing Syntactic Categories
### Adjectives
#### Adjectives vs. Modifiers

Linguistically, **modifiers** must serve a function (i.e., restricting or qualifying an expression), while **adjectives** are simply members of a syntactic category with certain formal properties.

> **Example**. "The candidate is *very suitable*."
> While "very suitable" is an adjective phrase, it isn't a modifier.

#### Adjective Usage

In English, adjectives typically appear **prenominally** (i.e., before the subject). When adjective phrases are long, they may appear **postnominally** instead (e.g., a story *unlikely to be true*).

>[!hint]
>**Adnominal** refers collectively to prenominal and postnominal.

Some adjectives can only take on an adnominal position and not a predicative one.

>**Example.**
>1. the mere fact
>2. the fact is mere*

#### Gradable Adjectives

**Gradable** adjectives can be modified in intensity (e.g., happy vs. happier vs. happiest; compatible vs. more compatible vs. most compatible). Meanwhile **categorical** adjectives can typically only be true or not (e.g., a number is prime or it isn't).

### Modals

English modals: can, could, may, might, must, shall, should, will, would

Modals derive from a special class of verbs in Proto-Germanic, but due to usage, etc. have become their own syntactic category.

#### Differences Between Modals and Verbs
- Never end in *-s*, even in singular past tense
- No nonfinite forms (infinitives, gerunds, past participles)
>**Examples.**
>- * They must *can* speak Spanish
>- * They want to *can* speak Spanish
>- * They like *cann-ing* play the piano
>- * They have *cann-ed* play the piano
- Lack of do supportâ€”when *do* is used to emphasize affirmative or negative sentences (e.g., "He *does* dance"; "He *doesn't* dance"). 

### Auxiliary Verbs

English's auxiliary verbs: be, do, have.

>[!note]
>All three of the auxiliary verbs have main verb usages (i.e., non-auxiliary usages). In these cases, they aren't subjected to the same rules as with auxiliary usages (e.g., lack of do support).


## Tests for Constituenthood

Often, syntactic constituency is not immediately clear, so linguists have developed a number of tests to track constituency.

| Test | How it works |
|-|-|
| Substitution | If a single word can substitute a string of several words, that's evidence for the string being a constituent. These substituting "placeholder" words are called **pro-forms** and include pronouns and adverbs like *here* and *there*. |
| Movement | If a string of words can be moved to the beginning of a sentence, that's typically evidence that it's a constituent. |
| Questions and short answers | If a string can function as a short answer to a question, it's likely a constituent. |
| *It* clefts | A string is a constituent if it can be the focus of an *it* cleft. | 

### More on *It* Clefts

Sentences can typically be divided into the **ground**, presupposed background info, and the **focus**, informative info. 

>**Example.** "(Ordinary cats) (detest the smell of citrus)."
>The first pair of parentheses denote the ground, while the second denote the focus.

*It* clefts take this **information structure** and fit it into the sentence frame, "It is X that Y."

>**Example.** "It is ordinary cats that detest the smell of citrus."


## Constituency

Syntactic structures are represented graphically as trees. Some terminology:
- **branches** = edges
- **terminal nodes** = leaves
- **nonterminal nodes** = internal nodes

### Dominance

Node A is said to **dominate** node B iff A is an ancestor of B. The root dominates all other nodes. Dominance is a transitive relation (i.e., if A dominates B and B dominates C, then A dominates C).

From the perspective of syntactic theory, it's simpler to view dominance as reflexive (i.e., nodes dominate themselves).

**Immediate dominance** denotes a parent-child relationship. (Note that immediate dominance is not transitive.)

Node A **exhaustively dominates** nodes B, C, ... iff A dominates all and only B, C, ...

### Precedence

If dominance looks at trees from top down, **precedence** looks at them left to right. Precedence and dominance are mutually exclusive.

### Branching

Nodes are classified as **nonbranching** (one daughter) or **branching** (more than one daughter).

In more detail,
- **unary-branching:** one daughter
- **binary-branching:** two daughters
- **ternary-branching:** three daughters (very rare)



## Questions
1. What is "exhaustively dominates"? (There also appears to be some missing parenthesis there)
2. Can a node precede a node it's not dominanted by with lesser depth?
