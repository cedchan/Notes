Each part of a grammar is considered to be a discrete combinatorial system, meaning that it has well-defined discrete parts that can be combined in a rule-driven way. Grammars thus comprise a **lexicon**, the basic units, and a **syntax**, the rules.

## Lexicon

Lexicons are in their most common form like dictionaries: lists of words with meanings. But the complexity of words warrants a more detailed information system, so lexicons will contain smaller units of meaning too.

The definition of a word is a much-debated topic without consensus across linguistics, but we know that uses criteria like "spaces" isn't sufficient. A better criterion may be units that can stand freely.

>**Morphemes** are the minimal units of a language with both sound and meaning.

### Part of Speech

In common grammar literature, part of speech is largely determined by semantic information: nouns are object, verbs are activities. In linguistics, the **distributional method** is used instead. In a nutshell, two words belong to the same class if you can substitute one for the other in a sentence. That is, we use their syntactic uses.
