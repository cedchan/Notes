Initially, we discussed vector spaces as linear combinations of numerical vectors. We can also do the same with our bases as functions. E.g., $\{1, x, x^2\}$. 

**Example.** $P_n$, the vector space of a polynomial up to $x^n$.
> $\{x^0, x^1, x^2, \dots, x^n\}$

There are five conditions that every vector space must hold:
1. $0+\vec{v}=\vec{v}$
2. $\lambda(\vec v_1+\vec v_2)=\lambda v_1+\lambda v_2$
3. $(\lambda_1+\lambda_2)\vec{v}=\lambda_1v+\lambda_2v$
4. $1\vec v=\vec v$
5. $\lambda_1(\lambda_2\vec v)=(\lambda_1\lambda_2)\vec v$

We show that a certain set of basis functions/vectors form a vector space by showing that these five conditions hold.
