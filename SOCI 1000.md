Durkheim identified four types of suicide: egoistic, altruistic, anomic, and fatalistic. Egoistic suicide occurs when individuals feel detached from society, lacking social integration. Altruistic suicide, on the other hand, stems from excessive integration, where individuals prioritize the collective over individual interests.
